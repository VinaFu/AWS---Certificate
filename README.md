1. Cloud - same with Azure

          On Premises: customer do all the things - include the infrastrauctures.
  
          IaaS provides access to resources such as virtual machines and virtual storage: Google compute engine
                infrastructure = actual servers
                scaling is fast; X own hardware
                pay-as-you-go
                agile
                No CapEx no upfront costs
                Consumption-based model(OpEx)
                allows to deploy [VMs + Networks + Physical Buildings + storage] in a cloud
          PaaS provides execution environments, application development, and deployment tools: Azure, AWS
                supports web application life cycle
                avoid license hell
                develop apps by themselves
                don't maintain/update the infrastructure
                No CapEx no upfront costs
                Extra agile
                less hardware and software skills needed
                Consumption-based model(OpEx)
                [IaaS + Middleware + Tools] deploy Web servers, database and development tools in a cloud
          SaaS provides software as a service to end-users: Google, Salesforce
                Providing a managed service
                pay an access fee to use/ pay-as-you-go
                No CapEx no upfront costs
                agile
                no maintenance and latest features
                software stored in a central location and customers access via subscription basis
                [PaaS + Apps] allows to run apps in cloud e.g Office 365
          FaaS Function as a server
                uses a service-hosted remote procedure call.
          DSaaS - data/ analytics
          NaaS - network transport connectivity
          Serverless 
                Azure is an instance of this
                Extreme PaaS
                deliver exact units of recources.
         [PaaS - extreme] - allocates the extract amount of application needs.
